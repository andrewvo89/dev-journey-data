  "description": "GraphQL is a data query and manipulation language for APIs, and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data. Developed by Facebook in 2012 and open-sourced in 2015, it provides an efficient and powerful alternative to RESTful APIs.\nIn contrast to traditional REST APIs, GraphQL exposes a single endpoint and allows clients to request exactly what they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data. This makes applications using GraphQL more efficient and fast, as they control the data they get, not the server.\nIts type system ensures the data you get is predictable and in the format you have defined, reducing the chances of encountering unexpected data from your API. Furthermore, GraphQL's introspection system allows for powerful tooling and robust API exploration.\nIt's not tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data, providing flexibility and adaptability in application design.",
