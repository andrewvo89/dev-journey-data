  "title": "Tauri",
  "description": "auri is an open-source framework for building lightweight, secure, and cross-platform desktop applications with web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). Tauri allows developers to write applications once and deploy them on multiple operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.\nThis software framework leverages Rust's robust ecosystem to deliver small binary sizes and improved security measures. Furthermore, it provides a flexible development experience as it can be integrated with any frontend framework such as Vue.js, React, Angular, Svelte, and many more.\nAs a result, Tauri is often compared to Electron, another popular framework for building desktop applications with web technologies. However, one of Tauri's key selling points is its ability to generate significantly smaller binaries than Electron, making it a suitable choice for developers concerned about the size and performance of their applications.",
